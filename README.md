### Build note(s)
- [ReVanced](https://github.com/revanced)
- We have to move back to a full apk instead of a split-apk.
- - Git _LFS_ is active since the apk files are over 100 MB.
- There are a 'few glitches'.

_Example: The video navigation might be stuck on screen the first video you play.<br>
A reboot will fix it and you should not run into it again._<br>

_Example: The top left (back) arrow might not work in some menus.<br>
You can just go back using you normal device back navigation._
